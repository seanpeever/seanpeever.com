      <h2>So who am I...</h2>
      <p>Clearly, I love technology. However, when you don't find me behind a keyboard - you'll probably find me hopping on a flight to explore a new city. I believe in traveling and exploring new cultures as often as you can. It's better to see something once than hear about it a thousand times.</p>
